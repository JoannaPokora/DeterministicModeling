# Modeling Temperature in a Room

One practical use of deterministic modeling is to simulate temperature changes in a house. This allows for optimization in radiator placement and usage. This project investigates two key questions:

1. Should radiators be placed under windows?
2. Should we turn off radiators before leaving the house for an extended period?

To answer these questions, heat equations and numerical schemes are utilized.
